# NumberGuesser
Number Guesser using Neural Network
Using the basic neural network structure from "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" by Michael Niesen, this project uses a pygame
drawing tool to guess drawn numbers. The network was trained in the test.py file, and then implemented in drawing.py.
The project uses a number of external packages including numpy, pillow, and scikit.
